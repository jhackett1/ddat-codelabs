This course will begin with a lot of code examples for you to type out. **Don't copy and paste these**. Manually typing them will help you get used to writing code.

You may be asked to type something without being shown what it does or why it works. Don't worry - to avoid overloading you the more complicated concepts are kept back for later.

## Can I learn to code?
Almost certainly.

If you: 
* have basic maths skills
* have ever learned a language (including your first language)
* are able to type

then you can probably learn to code!

It's just a matter of practice and motivation.

Computers weren't around for most of human history. No one is born with a talent for writing code. Everyone learns.

## How are modules structured?
Each module contains two kinds of content:

**Lessons** will teach you new concepts. These will then be reinforced with short exercises. All the code you need to write is provided in the text of the lesson.

**Project** tasks show you how to apply concepts we learn to your own project. They will be shown in the sidebar like this: <span class="project-badge">P</span>

<div class="todo">
		<h2>To do</h2>
		<p>If there is a project task for you to do they will appear like this.</p>
</div>

## What if I get stuck?
These lessons are intended for beginners so we don't expect you to have any existing coding knowledge.

If you get stuck go to the *#ddat-codelabs* channel on the [cross-government digital Slack team](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/). Your fellow learners and mentors will be in this channel.

If you can't access to that Slack team you can also email the [DDaT Codelabs volunteer team](mailto:ddatcodelabs@gmail.com).

If you are having trouble with a project task it may be useful to look at the code for an example app we built. You can copy this code if you need to - but we recommend writing your own.
